## Why GBP Matters

Google Business Profile is critical for local visibility in the commercial property sector:

- **83% of property management companies** have verified GBP listings - without one, you're invisible to local searchers
- **42% of local searches** result in clicks on the Map Pack (the 3 business listings shown with a map)
- **Direct ranking factor** for local SEO - GBP signals heavily influence local search rankings
- **Trust signal** - verified businesses with complete profiles appear more credible to potential clients
- **Free marketing channel** - posts, photos, and updates reach people actively searching for your services

For Hillway, having optimised profiles for both Sheffield and Doncaster offices means capturing commercial property searches across South Yorkshire.
